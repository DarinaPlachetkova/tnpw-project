                    <p class="led-mask-text-about">This age-defying technology is designed to help reduce the appearance of lines and wrinkles, helping to reveal youthful looking skin. Powered by the clinically proven technology of red and near infra-red LEDs, this mask targets multiple signs of ageing to revitalise skin. The intensive, but pain-free wavelengths are harnessed at the perfect level to work beneath the surface where skin ageing begins.</p>
                    <h3 class="directions-led-mask">Directions</h3>
                    <p class="led-mask-text-directions">Before starting a treatment, thoroughly cleanse your skin using your favourite cleanser and ensure your skin is clean and dry. After cleansing, place LED Mask comfortably over the face, securing the strap around your head. Use the mask for 10 minutes, five times a week. Remove the mask and follow with your favourite serum and moisturiser.</p>

                <div class="face-roller-text">
                    <p class="face-roller-text-about">Face rolling tools are made typically from jade, rose quartz or another crystal, and are designed to be used to gently massage the face and stimulate the lymphatic system to get rid of toxins, ease muscle tension, decrease puffiness and stimulate blood-flow to increase your skin’s glow. This act of a face rolling massage over the skin (always with an oil or serum for slip) is key to draining excess fluid from the face and, with regular use, will tone and lift the skin.</p>
                    <h3 class="directions-face-roller">Directions</h3>
                    <p class="face-roller-text-directions">Always do face rolling upwards and in one direction – never roll up and down. Repeat up to five upward rolls in each area. First, roll outwards under the jawline. Next, use the face roller to roll out, towards your hairline, under the cheekbones and then along them. Lastly, roll flat along the brows, and then upwards on the forehead. Work more slowly over the neck and jawline, but be brisk to firm over and under the cheeks.</p>

                    <p class="gua-sha-text-about">Typically, a polished tool made from jade or quartz is used to massage the face. Facial gua sha increases circulation and the production of anti-aging molecules, collagen, and elastin. Collagen helps to reduce wrinkles, and elastin helps to firm and tone the face. This increased circulation helps with detoxification.</p>
                    <h3 class="directions-gua-sha">Directions</h3>
                    <p class="gua-sha-text-directions">Facial gua sha should be practiced regularly to get the best result. Once or twice a week is ideal. Start at the chin, then sweep the gua sha tool along your jawline and up to the ear. Move the tool behind the earlobe, and then down the neck. Repeat three times.</p>

                    <p class="dermaplaning-text-about">Dermaplaning is a skin treatment that uses an exfoliating blade to skim dead skin cells and hair from your face. It’s also called microplaning or blading. Dermaplaning aims to make your skin’s surface smooth, youthful, and radiant. This treatment claims to remove deep scarring from acne and uneven pockmarks on your skin. It’s also used to remove “peach fuzz,” the short, soft hairs on your face.</p>
                    <h3 class="directions-dermaplaning">Directions</h3>
                    <p class="dermaplaning-text-directions">First, thoroughly cleanse and dry the skin. Then, take your blade in one hand and place it at the jawline. Hold the skin tight/taut with your opposite hand. Gently stroke the dermaplaning tool in short, feathery like strokes upward. Continue until you have covered the full cheek and jawline area on both sides. Once you're done, apply your treatment product or your moisturizer.</p>
